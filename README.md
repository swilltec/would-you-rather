# Would You Rather Project

"Would You Rather?"  udacity Project, is a user preference game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this game, users can answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.


## App Functionality

The gamer can login using an existing user. The application will work correctly regardless of which user is selected. Once the user logs in, the home page will be shown.

The authenticated user cusename and image are displayed at the navbar of the page to display. If gamer tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in the address bar, the user is asked to sign in and then the requested page is shown. The application allows the user to log out and log back in.

Once the user logs in, the user will be able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page, which is located at the root. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom). The unanswered questions are shown by default.

It would be no fun to vote in polls if we couldn’t post our own questions! The form for posting new polling questions will be available at the /add route. The application will show the text “Would You Rather” and have a form for creating two options. Upon submitting the form, a new poll will be created, the user will be taken to the home page, and the new polling question will appear in the correct category on the home page.

But how can we know how many questions each user has asked and answered? Let’s get some healthy competition going here! The application will have a leaderboard that’s available at the /leaderboard route. Each entry on the leaderboard contains the following:

- User’s name;
- User’s picture;
- Number of questions the user asked; and
- Number of questions the user answered

Users will be ordered in descending order based on the sum of the number of questions they’ve asked and the number of questions they’ve answered. The more questions you ask and answer, the higher up you move.

The user will be able to navigate to the leaderboard, to a specific question, and to the form that allows the user to create a new poll both from within the app and by typing in the address into the address bar. To make sure we’re showing the data that is relevant to the user, the application will require the user to be signed in order to access those pages.

## To Get Started:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user will have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### Users

Users include:

| Attribute    | Type             | Description           |

| avatarURL  | String           | The path to the image file |
| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.

Your code will talk to the database via 4 methods:

* `_getUsers()`

* `_saveQuestion(question)`
* `_saveQuestionAnswer(object)`

1) `_getUsers()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing users from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the user’s id and the value is the user object.

2) `_getQuestions()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing questions from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the question’s id and the value is the question object.

3) `_saveQuestion(question)` Method
